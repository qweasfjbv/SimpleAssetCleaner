	This asset includes:
		
		- Editor scripts for better UX.
		- Core scripts to perform functions.
		- Demo Scene to test editor funcs.


	What is this tool for :

        - Unity tool for clean unused assets by tracing dependencies.
        - You can check how much storage is used by unused files.


	How To Use:
		
        - Set path configs with PathConfigEditor (Tools -> SimpleAssetCleaner -> PathConfigEditor)
        - Find unused files with CleanerEditor (Tools -> SimpleAssetCleaner -> CleanerEditor)
        - Click "Find Unused Assets" button
            - You will then see unused assets with tree structure.
            - You can check the size of unused assets in console log.
        - Click "Delete Selected Assets" button to delete all selected files.

        [*Caution!*]
        - It traces dependencies from Scenes in Build Settings. (Build Profiles in Unity 6)
        - So If there are assets with dependencies from other locations, (ex. project settigns ...)
             you should add them to the Exclude Paths or manually uncheck them.
        - Assets dynamically loaded in the script cannot be tracked either.
        

	How To Modify:

		- If you want to modify the editor layout then:
			- Find scripts in SimpleCleaner/Scripts/Editor/
                - CleanerEditor.cs      : script to draw CleanerEditor.
                - AssetTreeView.cs      : script to display assets in the editor as a tree view.
                - PathConfigEditor.cs   : script to draw PathConfigEditor.

			- Find `OnGUI()` function
			- All the code for drawing the editor is there.

		- If you want to modify/optimize making progress then:
			- Find scripts in SimpleCleaner/Scripts/Core/
				- ConfigLoader.cs 	    : script to load scriptable objects.
				- PathFilter.cs 		: script to filter paths using configs.
